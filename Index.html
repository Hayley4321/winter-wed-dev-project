<h1 class="underline">Introduction to CSS</h1>
<p>CSS (<span class="bold underline">C</span>ascading <span class="bold underline">S</span>tyle <span class="bold underline">S</span>heets) is the code that styles web content. CSS basics walks through what you need to get started. We'll answer questions like: How do I make text red? How do I make content display at a certain location in the (webpage) layout? How do I decorate my webpage with background images and colors?</p>

<h2 class="underline">What is CSS?</h2>
<p>Like HTML, CSS is not a programming language. It's not a markup language either. CSS is a style sheet language. CSS is what you use to selectively style HTML elements. CSS handles the look and feel part of a webpage. Using CSS, you csan control the color of text, the style of fonts, the spacing betwen paragraphs, how columns are sized and laid out, what background images or colors are used, layout designs and variety of other effects.

<p>Let's dissect the CSS code for red paragraph text to understand how it works :

<p>The whole structure is called a ruleset. (The term ruleset is often referred to as just rule.) Note the names of the individual parts:

</p>
<h3 id="html-small-heading">Selector</h3>

<p>
    This is the HTML element name at the start of the ruleset. It defines the element(s) to be styled (in this example, <em>p</em> elements). To style a different element, change the selector.
</p>
<h3>Delaration</h3>
<p>
    This is a single rule like <em class="bold">color: red;</em>. It specifies which of the element's properties you want to style
</p>

<h3 id="html-small-heading">Properties</h3>
<p>
  These are ways in which you can style an HTML element. (In this example, <em>color</em> is a property of the <em>p</em> elements.) In CSS, you choose which properties you want to affect in the rule.
</p>

<h3>Property Value</h3>
<p>
  To the right of the property—after the colon—there is the <span class="bold">property value</span>. This chooses one out of many possible appearances for a given property. (For example, there are many color values in addition to red.)
</p>

<p>Note the other important parts of the syntax:</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Apart from the selector, each ruleset must be wrapped in curly braces. ({})
    </li>
    <li>
      Within each declaration, you must use a colon (:) to separate the property from its value or values.
    </li>
    <li>
      Within each ruleset, you must use a semicolon (;) to separate each declaration from the next one.
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
